# Friends List App

Hello my name is Raymond Liu.

This is my Ruby on Rails Friends app. 

This application is an extremely barebones Friends application which is essentially a contacts book similar to the one you can find on your phone. This application allows a user to sign in/out, add friends, edit friends, delete friends, and also to delete their account if they're not happy with the service. 

The main motivator for making this application was to help me better understand CRUD operations in Ruby and also to get my feet wet with Rails.
